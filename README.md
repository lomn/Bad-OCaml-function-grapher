# Bad-OCaml-function-grapher
This program is aimed at getting used to the basics of OCaml library Graphics.

It is not well wrote and not an accurate plot system (scale problems that I might fix soon if I find the time). The only goal of this repository is to publish some code writen with OCaml Graphics library as there is almost no simple codes writen with this librarary on the www.

Hopefully I will find some time soon to update this very bad thing into a decent prehistorical function grapher
